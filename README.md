# Comprehensive Analysis of COPDGene Data

This repository contains a Python script designed for the processing, analysis, and visualization of clinical phenotypic data related to pulmonary diseases. It integrates various data handling and preprocessing techniques, statistical analysis, and visualization to provide insights into the impact of diseases on patient phenotypes.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess metadata, gene expression counts, and phenotypic information.
- **Subject Classification:** Classify subjects by disease status and filter out non-smokers.
- **Data Visualization:** Generate plots and heatmaps to visualize data distributions, correlations, and disease impacts.
- **Confounder Correction:** Correct pulmonary function and CT scan features for confounders using regression analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform statistical analysis to understand the significance of differences across disease states.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- Custom modules: `visualization_helpers`, `data_processing`, `patient_classification`, `patient_statistics`, `analyze_symptoms`, `analyze_cbc`, `correct_confounders_pft`, `correct_confounders_ct`

## Installation

To run this script, you will need Python 3.x and the above-mentioned dependencies installed on your system. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```






# Differential Expression Analysis for COPD and ACO

This repository hosts a crucial upstream script within the `[Your Package Name]` package, designed for researchers and bioinformaticians focusing on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO). Utilizing a robust set of R packages, this script facilitates comprehensive differential expression analysis, from data preprocessing and normalization to advanced statistical testing and enrichment analysis.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Prepares gene expression data for analysis, supporting gene annotation and filtering.
- **Advanced Statistical Testing**: Leverages `limma` and `edgeR` for robust differential expression analysis.
- **Batch Effect Correction**: Implements methods to adjust for batch effects, ensuring accurate biological interpretation.
- **Enrichment Analysis**: Conducts KEGG pathway and GO term enrichment analysis to identify biologically significant pathways.
- **Detailed Logging**: Features custom logging for enhanced traceability and reproducibility of analysis results.
- **Visualization Support**: Provides tools for the visualization of analysis outcomes, aiding in the interpretation of complex datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure that you have R installed (version 3.6.0 or later recommended) along with the following packages: `limma`, `edgeR`, `org.Hs.eg.db`, `data.table`, and `biomaRt`.

### Installation Instructions

To install the necessary R packages, run the following commands in your R environment:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("limma", "edgeR", "org.Hs.eg.db", "data.table", "biomaRt"))
```
### Usage
Ensure your workflow is set up correctly with these steps:

### Prepare Your Data
Ensure differential expression data is in CSV format with gene IDs and log fold changes.

### Configure the Script
Adjust script parameters, including data file path and analysis settings, as needed.

### Execute the Analysis
Run the script in R to conduct the analysis and generate visualizations.

#### Example

```r
# Example code demonstrating script configuration and execution

# Define the data file path and analysis parameters
PATH <- "path/to/your/data"
lfc_threshold <- 0.5  # Log fold change threshold

# Commands to load data and perform analysis
load_data(PATH)
# Additional analysis commands
```
